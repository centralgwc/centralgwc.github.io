   <p><font face= "arial"><strong>Rena Rouge made her first debut as a fox themed superhero </strong>while helping Ladybug and Chat Noir capture the Akuma belonging to the Sapotis. She has advanced fighting skills, enchanted speed, strength, and agility. She uses her magical object (a flute) as a weapon, by calling on her mirage power. Her magic jewel is a necklace shaped like a fox tail, which was given to our mysterious hero by the one and only Ladybug herself.
